Conov with Allen
	Measure of Electoral system (permissive vs restrictive) is there a measure we can use or would we code this ourselves?
	Do we want to address breakdown - not really - we should treat it as a black box and refer to others
		(Use district magnitude)


Targetting 
	exclusive targetting leads parties to remain small
	if parties want to grow they have to broaden their appeal (less exclusionary/less populist)
		interacting w/electoral system/environmental hostility (include quadrent)


Populist targetting and adaptation
	if party wants more votes they have broaden appeal 

Bring in party convergence -> RRP pieces (remove "as far as we know no party etc...")


Restrict language to populism presence (avoid explaining exclusive/inclusive)

Better link cases with theory
